Simple Definition
A 'string' is simply a list of characters in order.

Python uses single quotes ('), double quotes ("), and triple quotes, (""")

>>> print ('I am a single quoted string')
I am a single quoted string

>>> print ("I am a double quoted string")
I am a double quoted string

>>> print ("""I am a triple quoted string""")
I am a triple quoted string


Escape special characters
>>> 'let\'s go'
"let's go"
