Simple Definition
A Variable is a storage "container" so to speak.

A variable can hold a string for example.

someString = "This is a string."
^             ^
Variable      string

Recall the Variable
>>> someString
'This is a string.

Recall the Variable Twice
>>> someString * 2
'This is a string.This is a string.'

Recall a stored string plus a string. String concatenation 
>>> someString + "Some other string!"
'This is a string.Some other string!'
